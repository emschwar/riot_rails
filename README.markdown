# Protest Rails

[Riot](http://github.com/thumblemonks/riot) macros for Rails application testing.

LOTS more to come ...

### ActiveRecord

Standard macros

* #validates\_presence\_of
* #allows\_values\_for
* #does\_not\_allow\_values\_for
* #validates\_uniquness\_of

Yes. Replacing Shoulda macros for now. Like I said with Riot, I love Shoulda.
