# Protest Rails

[Riot](http://github.com/thumblemonks/riot) macros for Rails application testing.

More to come ...

### ActiveRecord

Standard macros

* should\_validate\_presence\_of
* should\_allow\_values\_for
* should\_not\_allow\_values\_for
* should\_validate\_uniquness\_of

Yes. Replacing Shoulda macros for now. Like I said with Riot, I love Shoulda.
